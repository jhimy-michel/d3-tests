## d3-tests: JavaScript Technology Evolution Graph

This project is for learning about data visualization libraries. As a final test, we created a graph that shows the evolution of JavaScript technologies over time.

**Tech Stack:**

* React
* Vite
* Chakra UI
* TypeScript
* D3.js

**Live Demo:**

## About d3.js

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for manipulating and visualizing data. It allows you to create interactive and dynamic visualizations directly within your webpages. D3.js offers fine-grained control over every aspect of the visualization, making it suitable for complex projects.

## Data Visualization: Perception over Cognition

Data visualization uses visual elements to represent data, making it easier for humans to understand and analyze trends, patterns, and relationships. By converting data into visual elements like charts and graphs, data visualization allows our brains to use perception instead of complex cognitive processes to grasp information.

> "I think on paper" - Richard Feynman

This quote highlights the power of visualization in aiding our thought process. By externalizing data through visualization, we can more easily explore and analyze it.

## The Project

The project uses data from the 2019 State of JavaScript Survey ([https://2019.stateofjs.com/](https://2019.stateofjs.com/)) to visualize the trends in JavaScript technology adoption over time.
